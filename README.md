Objective:
You are provided with a dataset that simulates software sales data for a global IT company. Your task is to analyze the data to identify trends, provide insights into sales performance, and suggest actionable strategies that could be employed to improve sales outcomes.

Data Set:
The dataset includes the following fields (you may create a mock dataset based on these descriptions or use any similar public dataset):

Date of Sale
Region
Product Type
Sales Channel
Customer Type
Sales Amount
Units Sold
Marketing Spend
Returning Customer (Yes/No)
Tasks:
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Handle missing values, duplicate data, and possible outliers. Ensure data types are appropriate for analysis. Create any new calculated fields that you might find necessary for deeper analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Provide a descriptive analysis of the various attributesâ€”e.g., sales trends over time, best-performing regions/products, customer purchase patterns. Conduct a cohort analysis to understand customer retention based on the first purchase year.
Data Visualization: Create visualizations to illustrate the sales trends, distribution of sales across different categories, and any notable correlations. Develop at least one interactive dashboard in Power BI or any similar tool showcasing key sales performance metrics with filters for different dimensions (e.g., time period, region, product).
Predictive Modelling: Build a predictive model to forecast next quarter sales based on the provided data. You can use linear regression, time series forecasting, or any other suitable modelling technique. Evaluate the model's performance and discuss any assumptions or limitations.
Insight and Recommendation Report: Based on your analysis, draft a report summarizing your findings and insights. Provide strategic recommendations for the sales and marketing teams to improve software sales. Discuss how data analytics can be further integrated into the decision-making process to enhance business outcomes.
